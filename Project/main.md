**Context**: The client, from international high school in japan, are having an interests for the "Quotes". The client sometimes feels really depressed and tends to look at the quotes that give him/her a motivation for his/her life. A little while after he/she started doing that sort of thing, he/she started thinking that where thhese quotes came from, and who made this quotes. Since these quotes give him/her motivation and enrgy a lot, he/she wants to know who motivated me everyday, and who I have to thank for. Moreover, he/she started thinking that he_she also wants to make the quotes, be seen by everyone, and motivates everyone, because quotes helped him/her a lot in his/her life.

**Problem**:The client doesn't know who made the quotes that the client was motivated by, and the client want everyone to see client's quotes.

### Design Statement
I will design a social network service with using Python, HTML, CSS on the app called PyCharm. On the social network service, user can create their own account and login to the service.
